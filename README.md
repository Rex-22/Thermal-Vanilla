# Thermal-Vanilla

## Description
A light weight modpack that intended for small-medium servers or single-player. The focus is not on a single mod (Despite the name) but instead offers a you choice on what to focus on. The intended way to play this pack is with friends who are not all that familiar with modded Minecraft and offer a learning experience by providing some of the mods commonly used in other modpacks to introduce them to the shenanigans that is modded Minecraft.

The pack also includes vein miner just as a personal choice since the early game of Minecraft is very boring and very samie, vein miner provides a bit of a different experience in that regard making the early game a lot quicker.
